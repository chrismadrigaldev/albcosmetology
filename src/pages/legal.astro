  <p>
    This Legal Page is intended to protect the licensed cosmetologist, the
    business, and the website owner by clearly defining services, limitations,
    user responsibilities, and legal boundaries. By accessing or using this
    website, booking services, or communicating through this platform, you agree
    to the terms outlined below.
  </p>

  <ol class={legalStyles.legalSections}>
    <li>
      <h2>General Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        All services provided by <strong>ALB Cosmetology</strong> are performed by
        a licensed cosmetologist in accordance with the laws and regulations of
        the State of New Jersey. Results from cosmetology services may vary based
        on individual factors including, but not limited to, hair type, skin
        condition, prior treatments, maintenance habits, and adherence to
        aftercare instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        No guarantees are made regarding specific outcomes. By receiving
        services, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with
        cosmetology treatments.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Not Medical Advice</h2>
      <p>
        The information on this website is for general informational purposes
        only and is <strong>not</strong> intended as medical advice. Services
        provided are cosmetic in nature and do not replace consultation with a
        licensed medical professional, dermatologist, or physician.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a medical condition, allergy, sensitivity, or are pregnant,
        it is your responsibility to consult a medical professional prior to
        receiving services.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Client Responsibility &amp; Disclosure</h2>
      <p>Clients are solely responsible for:</p>
      <ul class={legalStyles.legalBullets}>
        <li>
          Disclosing all relevant medical conditions, allergies, medications, and
          prior cosmetic treatments
        </li>
        <li>
          Informing the cosmetologist of any discomfort, irritation, or adverse
          reactions immediately
        </li>
        <li>Following all pre-service and post-service care instructions provided</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Failure to disclose relevant information releases the cosmetologist and
        business from liability for adverse outcomes.
      </p>

        required for certain services.
      </p>
      <p>
        By proceeding with services, you acknowledge the risk of allergic
        reactions and release the cosmetologist from liability related to such
        reactions, unless caused by proven negligence.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Service Limitations &amp; Refusal of Service</h2>

    </li>
